### LO: Apply simple conditional, if and if-else blocks, to alter control flow in a program.

### Class Activities:
### Do now- starter code debugging
### Mini lesson- conditionals and triangles
### Student work- Lab 2.3a

### Do now- https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=eleite&ProjectName=Donow-%20101921
### Open the code and follow the instructions:
### 1- Choose mild, spicy, or HOT.
### 2- Find the corresponding script.
### 3- Perform the assigned tasks.

### Mini Lesson- triangles
### Equilateral- 
### Isosceles- 
### Scalene- 
### Right triangle- 
### Pre-condition of a triangle-

---

### Student work- pair programing 
### Ask for the sides of a triangle
### If the condition is not met, say “this is not a triangle. Please, try again.”
### Enter the sides of one specific triangle- equilateral, isosceles, right
### Draw the triangle
### Be sure to use the say blocks to comment the code
### CHALLENGE: ISOSCELES, EQUILATERAL, RIGHT
### Pair work protocol:
### Only one student codes- 5 minutes each
### When one is coding, the other is giving directions
### Switch
### Productive struggle- growing from adversity
### Open sharing of ideas

---

### Wrap Up- in the stream
### In a few words reflect on the pair programing experience
### What went well and what can be improved
