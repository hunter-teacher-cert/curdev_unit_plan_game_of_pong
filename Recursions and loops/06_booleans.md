### Class Activities:

### DISCUSS WITH YOUR PARTNER
#### Do now- are you going to the park today?
#### You will go to the park after school if: 
#### Condition 1- if:
#### It is sunny 
#### and 
#### You finish all your homework
#### Condition 2- if:
#### It’s sunny
#### Or
#### You passed all your classes in the 1sr MP
#### Thinking pairs-
#### You got home and it’s cloudy.
#### Can you go to the park based on condition 1?
#### Can you go based on condition 2?
#### Create a condition 2 that would ensure that you could go to the park today.

### Mini Lesson
#### Boolean operators
#### Logical Operators:
#### And: if both conditions are true, the expression is true
#### Or: if either condition is true, the expression is true
#### Not: if the condition is false, the expression is true

### Student Work
#### Use boolean operators to express the following and to check whether the expressions are true or false.B and C need variables.
#### A- (5 < 7) AND (4 > 2)
#### B- (x < 5) OR (x > 10)
#### C- (x =y) OR ((x > 0) AND (y < 0))) 
#### D- 5 is not > 7 and 4 is not < 2

#### Use if blocks, question blocks, answer blocks and say blocks with variables to code the following.
#### Ask and answer questions.
#### E- If x = 7; (x < 5) OR (x > 10)
#### F- x = 4 y = -3 (x == y) OR ((x > 0) AND (y < 0)))
