## LO: To introduce the concept variables to save a value throughout the execution of a program.
### The Big Question- why are variables essential to coding?

### Class Activities:
#### Do Now- 
#### Mini Lesson- back to variables
#### Student work

### Do now- The Guessing Game- 5 MIN

#### Step 1- write a number between 1-10 on a piece of paper
#### Step 2- Fold the paper and put in your pocket 
#### Step 3- EVERYBODY GETS UP AND MOVES TO THE EITHER SIDE OF THE ROOM- ROWS 1 AND 2 MOVE TO THE WALL- ROWS 3 AND 4 MOVE TO THE WINDOW
#### Step 4- Two students will move to the center of the room)
#### Step 5- One will ask the other to guess a number between 1-10; give the other student  3 chances- if they picked the right number say “you won”; if they don’t get the right number say “please, try again”; after 3 chances say “you lose”; in either case, you need to reveal your number.
#### Debriefing- 
#### What is the variable in this game?
#### Where is the variable been saved?
#### Explain this game using a simple if--else statement
#### Def variable: a location in memory to store a value for retrieval and use later

### Mini Lesson
#### Creating, assigning, and accessing a variable.
#### a variable can only hold one value at a time.
#### When a new value is assigned, the old value is lost and cannot be recovered.
#### Emphasize the importance of descriptive, readable names for variables.
#### Show that variables are independent.

### Student Work
#### Part 1: I'm thinking of a number
#### Write a program to choose a random number between 1 and 10 and then ask the user to guess a number. If the user's guess matches the random number, the user wins. If not, the user loses. In either case, the user should be shown a message indicating whether they won, lost and the secret random number should be revealed.
#### Form groups of 4
#### Complete a planning worksheet for the above script.
#### Explain how the game will work
#### Mention the blocks that will be used Describe the function of each block within the code
#### ONE SUBMISSION PER GROUP WILL ALL NAMES
#### CHALLENGE
#### Modify the script to keep track of how many guesses the player has made. After the player guesses correctly, inform them how many tries it took before the correct number was guessed. And say how many times he player tried.
#### Student work- write the code
#### Deliverables- the plan and the code
#### Location- GC
