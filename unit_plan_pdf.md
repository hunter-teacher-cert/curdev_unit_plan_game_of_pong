# UNIT PLAN NAME- Recursions and Loops
##### By Eduardo Leite

-----

## General Overview 
##### This unit will introduce students to the skills necessary to create games, animations, and any type of code that requires repetition for an extended period. 
##### In order to create a game, the students need to learn how to develop routines that allow for player interaction, repetition, conditionals, and point systems. Students also need to learn conditionals and boolean reasoning in order to create code that depends on user input.
##### After this unit, students will be able to create a game to be played by two players with rules, stops and starts, and winners and losers.

### Established Goal(s) of the Unit/ Justification Narrative:
### Students will be able to...
##### Define loop in a programming context. 
##### Explain why loops are useful. 
##### Implement simple repeat and forever loops in Snap! 
##### Apply loops to reduce redundancy in code.
##### Apply/Ask and Receive in Snap!
##### Apply simple conditional, if and if-else blocks, to alter the execution of code.
##### Use repeat, repeat until, and forever blocks to user input coding.
##### Utilize Boolean operators, and, or, not, to create compound conditions.

## Motivation for Unit
##### Our students are consumers of the technology that they use on a regular basis. This unit will allow them to become producers of a game that resembles the popular games that they play.

### Real world connections: 
##### The students will be able to make connections between the skills learned and the applications in gaming and entertainment.
##### The goal is for all students to create the same game. However, an extension would be for them to create their own game and to explore game creation as an artistic form that relies on the coding skills learned.
##### Cultural elements will be added to game, such as music, setting, and character choice.
##### Socially relevant issues connected to the gaming industry will be discussed via article.
##### Students will have the opportunity to identify racial bias in games.
##### Online security protocols- privacy versus social safety. When is it acceptable to surrender our privacy?
##### How video games affect children’s behavior- the role of parents and adults in the conversation about video games.

## Tools Used:
##### This class runs on Snap, a block-based program developed by UC Berkely and supported by TEALS CS4All. 
##### In addition to Snap, we use Google Classroom for assignments because that is the platform endorsed by the DOE.
##### Google Slides is the presentation tool used evey day in the classroom.
##### From time to time we watch videos on Youtube.
##### For grading we use Skedula.
##### From time to time we use Padlet.
##### Our Promethean Board is also a tech tool that allows for versatility.
##### Notebook is used weekly as I assign do nows that require short, written responses.
##### Post it's for unplugged activities.

#### If not, the user loses. In either case, the user should be shown a message indicating whether they won, lost and the secret random number should be revealed.
#### Requirements:
#### Form groups of 4
#### Complete a planning worksheet for the above script.
#### Explain how the game will work
#### Mention the blocks that will be used

### Mini Lesson
#### Boolean operators
#### Logical Operators:
#### And: if both conditions are true, the expression is true
#### Or: if either condition is true, the expression is true
#### Not: if the condition is false, the expression is true

### Student Work
#### Use boolean operators to express the following and to check whether the expressions are true or false.B and C need variables.
#### A- (5 < 7) AND (4 > 2)
#### B- (x < 5) OR (x > 10)
#### C- (x =y) OR ((x > 0) AND (y < 0))) 
#### D- 5 is not > 7 and 4 is not < 2

#### Use if blocks, question blocks, answer blocks and say blocks with variables to code the following.
#### Ask and answer questions.
#### E- If x = 7; (x < 5) OR (x > 10)
#### F- x = 4 y = -3 (x == y) OR ((x > 0) AND (y < 0)))

### Mini Lesson- Pong Game
#### What you need- read the instructions
#### WARNING- Somebody found my code online- if you submit that, your group will get ZERO and the parents will be called- cheating
#### If you finished the planning sheet, please, proceed to the code
#### Each student is working on one aspect of the game ONLY: ball movement; point counting; paddle movement, etc.
#### I will make changes to the project guidelines
### The Pong Game
##### Students will implement a well-written and engineered version of the classic arcade game Pong.
#### Overview
##### In 1972, when video games were still very new and relatively unknown, a new game took the world by storm.
##### A simple simulation of tennis using two-dimensional graphics, minimal sounds, and extremely basic controls,
##### Pong became the first arcade game to achieve widespread popularity and is credited as the genesis of themodern video game industry. Today, the game has been played, remade, spun-off, and referenced innumerable times and it remains, to many, the single most identifiable and recognizable game in the history of video games.
#### Details
##### 1. Behavior
##### i. Gameplay
##### Pong is played by two players each controlling a paddle with the goal of defending their end of the "field." A ball begins play in the middle of the screen and, at the start of each round, moves in a random direction. The ball bounces off the upper and lower edges of the field and the players' paddles. Each time the ball bounces off a paddle, its speed increases by a small amount. When the ball bounces off a paddle, its direction is reversed with a small random variation to add unpredictability to the game.
##### ii. Scoring
##### If the ball touches the left or right edge of the field, a point is scored for the opponent of the player who was defending that edge and the ball resets to the middle of the field. When one player reaches 5 points, the game is over and that player is the winner. The winner is announced on the screen and the players are given the opportunity to start a new game.
##### iii. Player Control
##### Paddles are positioned a short distance away from the side they are defending, and can only move up and down, not side to side. Each player should have two keys to control the movement of their paddle: one for up, and one for down. Paddles move at a set speed that is the same for both players can cannot be controlled. The player on the left will control his/her paddle with the 'w' and 's' keys. The player on the right will use the up arrow and down arrow keys.
##### 2. Required Checkpoints
##### i. Players can control paddles; the ball starts in the middle, moves in a random direction, and bounces
##### ii. The ball speeds up when it hits a paddle, and resets to the middle when it hits the left or right edge
##### iii. A point is scored when the ball hits the edge on the opponent's side of the field; the game ends when one player reaches five points; players can start a new game after the game ends.
