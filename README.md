# UNIT PLAN NAME- Recursions and Loops
##### By Eduardo Leite

-----

## General Overview 
##### This unit will introduce students to the skills necessary to create games, animations, and any type of code that requires repetition for an extended period. 
##### In order to create a game, the students need to learn how to develop routines that allow for player interaction, repetition, conditionals, and point systems. Students also need to learn conditionals and boolean reasoning in order to create code that depends on user input.
##### After this unit, students will be able to create a game to be played by two players with rules, stops and starts, and winners and losers.

### Established Goal(s) of the Unit/ Justification Narrative:
### Students will be able to...
##### Define loop in a programming context. 
##### Explain why loops are useful. 
##### Implement simple repeat and forever loops in Snap! 
##### Apply loops to reduce redundancy in code.
##### Apply/Ask and Receive in Snap!
##### Apply simple conditional, if and if-else blocks, to alter the execution of code.
##### Use repeat, repeat until, and forever blocks to user input coding.
##### Utilize Boolean operators, and, or, not, to create compound conditions.

## Motivation for Unit
##### Our students are consumers of the technology that they use on a regular basis. This unit will allow them to become producers of a game that resembles the popular games that they play.

### Real world connections: 
##### The students will be able to make connections between the skills learned and the applications in gaming and entertainment.
##### The goal is for all students to create the same game. However, an extension would be for them to create their own game and to explore game creation as an artistic form that relies on the coding skills learned.
##### Cultural elements will be added to game, such as music, setting, and character choice.
##### Socially relevant issues connected to the gaming industry will be discussed via article.
##### Students will have the opportunity to identify racial bias in games.
##### Online security protocols- privacy versus social safety. When is it acceptable to surrender our privacy?
##### How video games affect childrenâ€™s behavior- the role of parents and adults in the conversation about video games.

## Standards Referenced
##### 4-6.CT.4- Decompose a problem into smaller named tasks, some of which can themselves be decomposed into smaller steps. 
##### 9-12.CT.5- Modify a function or procedure in a program to perform its computation in a different way over the same inputs, while preserving the result of the overall program.
##### 7-8.CT.5- Identify multiple similar concrete computations in a program, then create a function to generalize over them using parameters to accommodate their differences
##### 4-6.CT.5- Identify and name a task within a problem that gets performed multiple times while solving that problem, but with slightly different concrete details each time.
##### 9-12.CT.6- Demonstrate how at least two classic algorithms work, and analyze the trade-offs related to two or more algorithms for completing the same task.
##### 4-6.CT.7- Identify pieces of information that might change as a program or process runs.
##### 4-6.CT.8- Develop algorithms or programs that use repetition and conditionals for creative expression or to solve a problem.
##### 7-8.CT.8- Develop or remix a program that effectively combines one or more control structures for creative expression or to solve a problem.
##### 7-8.CT.10- Document the iterative design process of developing a computational artifact that incorporates user feedback and preferences.
##### 7-8.CY.3- Describe trade-offs of implementing specific security safeguards.
##### 9-12.DL.2- Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.
##### 7-8.DL.5- Transfer knowledge of technology in order to explore new technologies.
##### 7-8.DL.2- Communicate and collaborate with others using a variety of digital tools to create and revise a collaborative product.

## Tools Used:
##### This class runs on Snap, a block-based program developed by UC Berkely and supported by TEALS CS4All. 
##### In addition to Snap, we use Google Classroom for assignments because that is the platform endorsed by the DOE.
##### Google Slides is the presentation tool used evey day in the classroom.
##### From time to time we watch videos on Youtube.
##### For grading we use Skedula.
##### From time to time we use Padlet.
##### Our Promethean Board is also a tech tool that allows for versatility.
##### Notebook is used weekly as I assign do nows that require short, written responses.
##### Post it's for unplugged activities.

## Lessons
#### Total lenght: 2 Weeks
#### Below is a list of the Learning Objective for each day as the students develop the skills necesssary to create their games:
##### 1. Apply simple conditional, if and if-else blocks, to alter control flow in a program.
##### 2. To introduce the ask block with conditional answers.
##### 3. To introduce the concept variables to save a value throughout the execution of a program.
##### 4. To inquire into the social and ethical issues related to CS
##### 5. How do we identify and utilize boolean operators?
##### 6. How to design and explain the basic structure for a Game of Pong.
##### 7. How do we create an interactive game for two players?
##### 8. How do we count points and declare a winner in a game?
##### 9. To complete the code for a Game of Pong.
